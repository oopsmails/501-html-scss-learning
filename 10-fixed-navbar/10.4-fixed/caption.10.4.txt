00:00
the very first video I ever made here on
00:02
YouTube was on how to make a navbar with
00:04
a cool little hover effect and I really
00:07
liked that video and it's actually my
00:09
most popular video which is kind of cool
00:11
because it was the very first one I ever
00:13
did but it's a little bit you know I
00:16
used floats and it wasn't responsive I
00:18
get lots of questions on that video
00:20
about doing some more interesting things
00:22
with it so that's exactly what we're
00:24
gonna do in this video I'm back it's
00:30
been three weeks and honestly I miss
00:32
making this video so I'm really happy to
00:33
be back real life was just crazy it was
00:36
insane now I finally have some time to
00:38
breathe in sista and because of that it
00:44
also means that I have time to make
00:45
these videos again which is great so
00:48
thank you for being patient with me if
00:50
this is your first video and you didn't
00:51
even know I was on a break or you're
00:53
watching this in the future yeah well
00:55
welcome if you don't already know my
00:57
name is Kevin and here at my channel I
00:58
make videos where we explore how to make
01:01
the web and how to make it look good
01:02
while we're at it with a new video every
01:04
single week well almost every single
01:07
week as it just said it took a little
01:08
break but for the most part it's every
01:10
single week so as I mentioned my very
01:12
first video I made this navbar here that
01:14
you can see on the screen and I think it
01:15
looks good I really do like it but it's
01:18
not responsive as I said and I think it
01:21
really could be improved and we're gonna
01:23
do a lot of good things to improve it
01:24
but I'm not just gonna go back in and
01:26
refactor it we're gonna go in and just
01:27
rip it all apart and well no we're not
01:29
ripping apart we're starting from zero
01:30
I'm just gonna start from scratch we're
01:32
gonna build it up I'm gonna make it
01:34
responsive we're gonna have a nice
01:35
little like a clicky box it's gonna go
01:37
up and down with no JavaScript so I
01:38
think that's gonna be cool we'll throw a
01:40
little CSS variable in there for fun
01:42
we're gonna be using CSS grid we're
01:43
gonna be using flexbox we're gonna be
01:45
bringing it to the modern times and
01:47
modern CSS that we have now so I will be
01:50
looking at a lot of little things along
01:52
the way that I've explored in more
01:54
detail in my other videos so down in the
01:56
description below there'll be links to a
01:57
lot of my other videos just ones that go
02:00
more in depth on some of the topics that
02:02
I'm briefly going over so in this video
02:04
even if you're not sure what a CSS
02:06
variable is you'll be able to follow
02:07
along no problem but if you want more
02:09
details on it
02:10
they'll be down in the description also
02:13
you might notice that it's a longer
02:15
video so what I've done is I put
02:17
timestamps down in the description as
02:18
well I actually ran a poll on whether
02:20
you guys would like to have one big long
02:23
video or lots of little videos and I was
02:25
surprised that it was a pretty even
02:28
split the lots of little videos actually
02:30
won but I just thought that because it
02:32
was so close and because of the the
02:34
topic of this video it would make more
02:36
sense to have one big long one just with
02:37
some timestamps along the way so that's
02:39
what we're gonna be doing the way that
02:40
works is if you go and look in the
02:42
description you'll see the time so
02:43
they're actually linked so if you click
02:44
on say the the third one down you click
02:46
on the little timestamp and it's gonna
02:48
bring you exactly to there in the video
02:50
so if you don't have time to watch the
02:52
whole thing at once that's fine because
02:54
you can just come back later on go oh I
02:56
was at adding in the pseudo elements and
02:58
click on that and it will bring you to
03:00
that part of the video right away so
03:03
it's little bookmark type II things with
03:05
all that out of the way I think it's
03:06
time we get into this let's go rock it
03:08
now first things first we've got to
03:10
write some markup luckily it's pretty
03:12
easy to do for this and you'll notice I
03:14
am in code pen so the link to this is
03:16
down in the description below if you
03:17
want to go and check out my code and
03:19
play around with it as you follow along
03:21
in the video or afterwards I do have a
03:24
little bit of something here this is
03:26
just a place well there were some actual
03:27
content will go so we can see what it
03:29
looks like with content once we've built
03:32
this out so let's start just by making a
03:34
nice big header here close header inside
03:39
my header I'm just gonna use an h1 with
03:41
a class of logo on it so we can have our
03:44
logo which I don't actually have one so
03:47
I'm just gonna write logo in there for
03:49
now for a little bit of a placeholder
03:50
for where we could be putting a logo and
03:53
then we need our actual navigation so
03:55
I'm gonna come in here and make a nav
03:58
close my nav off and we're gonna do this
04:01
with an unordered list because this is
04:04
what you'll usually find out in the real
04:06
world so for this we need a list item
04:10
and in our list item we will be putting
04:13
in an H ref we have nowhere for it to go
04:15
now but hopefully you would actually
04:17
have somewhere for this to be going to
04:18
and for my H ref the first one can be
04:21
home
04:22
a and close ally and just to make my
04:26
life a little bit easier let's copy this
04:28
one and paste it in there a few times we
04:32
have a few different links let's say
04:34
it's a boat we'll do a blog and we'll do
04:39
the contact there we go so the main
04:47
reason again with this is just so we can
04:48
see what happens sort of when we scroll
04:50
so it gives us a bit more of a realistic
04:51
look that's why I added this whole
04:53
content thing down here and that's it
04:57
for the markup it's nice and simple
04:59
there so now with that done we can start
05:01
codon and up we're going to start with
05:03
the mobile view and then we'll move up
05:05
to the desktop screen sizes once we're
05:06
finished with that so I'm gonna just
05:09
take this and we don't actually need to
05:11
be looking at this anymore so I'm gonna
05:12
bring up my CSS now you'll see that I
05:14
have some styling here already so up
05:18
here I'm just ringing my Google font
05:19
here I'm setting up a CSS custom
05:22
property or a CSS variable here at the
05:24
top if you've never seen these I do have
05:27
a series on how they work but for the
05:28
very basics of it you'll very easily be
05:30
able to follow along for this video and
05:32
once you see me using it I think you'll
05:34
quickly understand exactly how it works
05:38
here I have a reset for my box sizing
05:42
which I do one pretty much all my
05:44
projects and then I just have some basic
05:46
styles will hit my content section and
05:48
just some basic styles here on my body
05:51
just so we have somewhere where we're
05:53
starting off with so what I'm going to
05:55
do is I'm actually going to leave all
05:56
that at the top there and then I'm going
05:58
to come down here just because I will be
05:59
showing this and let's just put in a
06:01
little comment comment here saying
06:04
navigation Styles start here and we'll
06:11
work from here on out so the very first
06:13
thing I have here is my header so let's
06:16
style that up so I have my header and
06:17
right away we're gonna use that variable
06:21
that I was just talking about so to use
06:23
it I have to write var and then open and
06:25
close my parentheses and then I write
06:27
the name that I created so background
06:28
and you can see that color that I used
06:31
where is it right here
06:33
so this RGB a value is getting brought
06:36
in
06:36
right there so this had come in more
06:39
handy once we start reusing this or if
06:41
we do decide to reuse it in different
06:44
places or if we need to change it later
06:46
on what else do we need to do I want to
06:50
do a text-align:center on this and I'm
06:56
going to do a position fixed I've had a
06:58
lot of questions about how to do this so
07:00
it's nice and easy to position fixed and
07:03
then for now I'm just going to do a
07:04
width of 100% so now if I scroll you can
07:09
see that it stays there and because I'm
07:11
using an RGB a value you can see that
07:13
there is a little bit of transparency in
07:15
there so we can play with that number a
07:17
little bit I'm on how transparent you
07:21
want it but I think that looks nice now
07:25
one thing because this is position fixed
07:27
just to make sure that it's always on
07:29
top of everything we can give it a
07:30
really nice big z-index something like
07:33
that and it depends on how you're using
07:35
your Zend indexes and everything but a
07:37
nice big number just doing ensure that
07:39
it's always all the way on top of
07:41
everything else so that's good now let's
07:43
actually get inside our header so the
07:45
very first thing we have is our logo and
07:47
because this isn't h1 with some text I'm
07:49
going to say that the margin is 0 on it
07:51
so actually I don't think I need to
07:54
style anything on it but if you wanted
07:55
to just know that the space around it
07:57
right now is being created by the margin
07:59
so it is possible that you might want to
08:00
reset that at one point or change the
08:03
spacing around it because this is sort
08:04
of going to decide on how tall our whole
08:06
navigation is since it's the biggest
08:09
element inside of my navigation but for
08:11
now I'm just gonna not even bother
08:13
putting anything so right now it's
08:15
starting to look good but my navigation
08:17
is in the wrong place what do we want is
08:18
to bring it over to the side here
08:20
because eventually it will move up and
08:21
down with a thing that we're gonna click
08:23
on now I haven't done the markup for
08:24
that yet I'm saving that for a little
08:26
bit after I'm just cuz it's gonna make
08:28
more sense once everything is set up to
08:30
add that little bit of markup in there
08:32
we're almost there - so let's go and
08:34
look at my nav first of all so I always
08:37
work from the outside in so let's start
08:39
with the whole nav itself so I'm going
08:42
to use a position:absolute on this so
08:45
because this has a position fixed
08:47
already on it this position:absolute
08:48
will be
08:49
relative to where the overall
08:52
positioning of this is which will make
08:55
my life a little bit easier I'm gonna do
08:58
a text-align:left because my text isn't
09:02
in the middle it looks weird if it's
09:05
centered off on the side here so let's
09:07
do a text-align:left on that the tops
09:11
already I think at the right spot but
09:13
I'm gonna say top 100 percent so again
09:16
that's relative to this so if I did like
09:18
top 50 percent just to look at it the
09:21
top of this well there's a little bit of
09:24
margin on the top so of the list itself
09:28
but the top of this is lining up pretty
09:31
much with the middle of this and I don't
09:33
want it to line up in the middle I want
09:34
to line up underneath that so that's why
09:36
top we're moving a hundred percent away
09:38
from the top which is here so a hundred
09:41
percent of the way down and then let's
09:45
just do a left of zero so I can control
09:47
exactly where it's going to be and
09:49
you'll say it doesn't look left zero we
09:51
do have padding on here as well because
09:53
of my nav ul which we'll look at in a
09:56
second I think that's all we need on
09:59
there so let's keep going and so let's
10:02
look at our nav ul next so on my nav ul
10:06
what do we need we need to do this is
10:08
where the margin:0 padding:0 and I'll do
10:11
a list-style:none that gets rid of the
10:14
bullet points and all of that and now
10:16
you can see it's actually lining up at
10:17
the top and it's actually all the way on
10:19
the side they're good and now we can do
10:22
my nav Li and on my nav li I want to
10:26
spread them out so it's at a margin
10:27
bottom I don't know one M just to spread
10:30
them out a little bit and I'll do a
10:32
margin left of one M as well to give it
10:35
some space on the side here now this is
10:37
where I did I really need to reset this
10:40
exactly and this margin here could
10:44
actually be up on the UL it just depends
10:46
on how you like to work there's no from
10:50
I think anywhere in my opinion it's just
10:52
preference on where you're doing this to
10:54
move it around but I like just resetting
10:57
that and then I like positioning my list
10:59
items sort of like this because when we
11:02
into the other view we're going to be
11:03
playing with the margin left as well on
11:05
these to space them out when they're
11:07
actually one next to each other instead
11:09
of on top of each other like this just
11:11
start making it look a little bit better
11:12
my nav a so when I have a color let's
11:17
get rid of it let's make a color white
11:18
text Declaration of none we could really
11:24
make the font size a bit bigger font
11:25
size of one point I don't know to REM
11:28
something like that that looks a little
11:30
bit nicer I'll do a text transform of
11:34
upper case if you've never used MS or
11:38
REMS by the way I'm there pretty simple
11:40
to use and I'd encourage you to start
11:42
learning a little bit more about them I
11:44
do have a video on that I'll link to it
11:46
in the description below as well so that
11:50
looks okay we need a little bit of a
11:52
hover effect on these though I think so
11:53
I'll do it nav a:hover so on this I
11:58
think we'll just change the color say
12:01
over to black instead of white I know I
12:04
can't see it now and I just realized I
12:06
need my background so this background
12:07
color here I want it to also be down
12:11
there so that would be on the nav itself
12:12
I just completely forgot so here we can
12:15
come in a new background and use my
12:17
variable background and I guess I'll
12:24
also need to do a width of 100% there we
12:27
go
12:28
cool so that o is I'm pretty happy with
12:31
how that looks
12:32
now just to really reinforce why I'm
12:34
using this variable background instead
12:36
of just putting the number in so here I
12:37
have the background and here I have the
12:39
background and potentially be having it
12:41
in other places well maybe background
12:43
wouldn't be the best name and if you
12:46
were using in other places well let's
12:48
just say I came in here and I change it
12:49
in this one spot the color changes in
12:52
both of them and actually I like that
12:54
color better so I'm going to leave that
12:55
alone but let's just put this to zero to
12:57
really change it so you can see I'm
12:59
using this color in two different places
13:01
and by changing it here and this should
13:03
make it black zero it's changing it in
13:07
both of them at the same time so that's
13:09
pretty cool and yeah I think I'm gonna
13:11
stick with this I like the more vibrant
13:12
color that I just got by doing that so
13:15
I'm going to
13:15
with that also sorry I'm scrolling
13:18
around but here you know if you wanted
13:20
to make it no more transparent I could
13:22
turn it off I could come here to point
13:24
five and make it more transparent and
13:26
it's doing every instance of this all at
13:29
the same time so that's why I set this
13:32
up here it just makes life a little bit
13:35
easier instead of trying to remember hex
13:36
codes or RGB values I'm cool
13:39
so my menu is there but obviously I
13:41
can't actually toggle it right now and
13:43
that's a big part of having a mobile
13:45
navigation is wanting it to sort of hide
13:47
and come out so we've gotta have
13:51
something to click on so this is gonna
13:53
seem a little bit strange but I'm
13:55
actually going to come in here and I'm
13:57
and I had a checkbox and I'll explain
14:00
why don't worry so input type equals
14:03
checkbox and I'll give this a class of
14:09
nav toggle so all that's done is given
14:16
me this little checkbox here seems a
14:18
little bit strange and I agree it is at
14:21
the moment so the whole reason I'm gonna
14:22
be doing this is because I want to do
14:25
this without any JavaScript we want to
14:26
do this CSS only and we can it's not
14:28
that hard and it's important that I'm
14:31
putting this right before my navigation
14:33
with how the doing this with CSS works
14:36
it's really important on the ordering of
14:38
these two things so to give you an idea
14:41
of how this is going to work let's say
14:42
that my navigation is actually
14:47
display:none
14:48
so it disappears cool and I'm gonna
14:52
scroll down here and what did we call it
14:55
we called it nav toggle so if you don't
14:58
know there is a pseudo class yeah
15:03
pseudo class and you know hover so hover
15:06
is a pseudo class you probably might
15:08
know like active and all that there's
15:09
also another one called checked so
15:11
checked is looking for if a checkbox is
15:14
checked and then what we can do is do a
15:17
little tilde here and say map
15:21
so what this is saying is as you know if
15:25
you you don't have a space so like here
15:27
with my nav
15:28
this is a link inside my navigation so
15:33
if I put this it's not looking for a nav
15:35
inside of Naftogaz
15:37
it's looking for a nav that's a sibling
15:39
of nav toggle so my nav toggle is here
15:44
its first sibling right after it I think
15:47
it's the first preceding sibling is what
15:49
this is looking for so it's looking for
15:52
is there a nav right after there is a
15:56
nav right after so what can we do with
15:57
it
15:58
so display:block so if it's checked my
16:04
nav which is right after my nav toggle
16:07
should become block when it's checked
16:10
like like that there it is
16:12
if I uncheck it it disappears so right
16:15
away I think you can see the value in
16:17
this and I think you get the idea of
16:19
where I'm going but you don't want a
16:22
checkbox do you know we don't want to
16:24
check box we want something that looks
16:25
like a hamburger menu so let's go and
16:27
make that and this is me I don't know if
16:31
the where I'm putting this is terribly
16:33
important it could be somewhere else but
16:35
I'm going to put it down here underneath
16:37
and I'll give this and so I'm gonna make
16:41
a label here and it's gonna be a label
16:42
for my nav toggle and I need to give it
16:47
a name so let's give it a class of nav
16:51
toggle label and a label I'm going to
16:58
close my label here and inside of my
17:01
label I'm gonna add in a span closed
17:05
path so the advantage with a label and
17:08
actually in my span for the moment I'll
17:11
put a big X and I just realized
17:14
something and doing this so I'm putting
17:15
my four here when I did my input we also
17:18
need to give it an ID so the ID of this
17:20
will also be now a photographer
17:23
generally when I say generally I always
17:26
do this where my navigation or my input
17:29
will have an ID and a class and the
17:32
reason I like putting both on them is in
17:33
my CSS
17:34
I prefer only working with classes and
17:37
not with ideas just for specificity
17:39
reasons the IDS are much higher in spy
17:42
so they can cause some issues with it I
17:44
know I'm sayin specificity really weird
17:46
it's a word I have trouble with I have a
17:48
whole video that dives into it a little
17:50
bit and you can listen to that if you're
17:52
curious and just listen to me stumble
17:54
over it but basically this is for me to
17:57
select here and my ID here is because I
18:00
want my label and my input to work
18:03
together so this nav toggle so for nav
18:06
toggle is going to look for an ID it
18:08
will not see it the class so now if I
18:12
come up and click on here you'll see
18:13
that it works but if I click on the X it
18:16
also activates and deactivates it even
18:18
though I'm clicking on the X and I'm not
18:20
clicking in the check box itself so what
18:23
all that means is I can come up to here
18:26
and say that my nav toggle has a display
18:33
of none we don't need to have that there
18:36
I only need to have this so even though
18:38
we can't see it it's still being checked
18:40
on and off so it's really really nice
18:42
and handy but I don't actually want this
18:46
to be an X we want to do a little bit
18:48
more with it so let's do all that I'm
18:55
gonna keep all of this above my now
18:57
actually actually you know what for now
19:02
for the moment I think what we'll do is
19:04
we'll put the X back in here just so we
19:06
can get it positioned where we want it
19:07
to so I'll move the x over to here and
19:09
then we'll change our X into the 3 bars
19:11
so here I am a nav toggle label so my
19:18
nav toggle label let's see this is gonna
19:21
have to be a position:absolute on here
19:23
because we want to tell it where it's
19:25
gonna go let's just do a top of 0 and a
19:29
left of 0 so we should see it showing up
19:31
there it is so it shows up right there
19:34
now I want the the let's just give that
19:37
a margin left of 1 M and the reason I'm
19:41
doing the margin left of 1 M there is
19:43
just because I give that margin left of
19:45
1 M so I just want these things to line
19:47
up perfectly now I'm gonna put a border
19:50
on this just so we can see what's
19:52
happening so I'm going to do a border of
19:53
1 pixel
19:55
solid red and we can see it it looks
19:58
like that and I want to be able to
20:00
Center my X perfectly in this space so
20:03
I'm gonna give it a height of 100% to do
20:05
that I'm also gonna give it a display of
20:08
flex and the reaiiy know we only have
20:11
one thing in there it's because this
20:12
makes it easier because then I can use
20:14
it in the line items center and my X
20:18
goes right in the middle of the height
20:20
there so I need to give it the height
20:22
display flex and then align Adams Center
20:24
and there's other ways of centering it
20:26
that don't require flex but yeah that
20:30
works well so I think we'll leave that
20:32
and I can turn off my board right now so
20:35
that's in the right spot but I don't
20:36
actually want something that's a little
20:38
X I want my three lines so to do that
20:42
I'm gonna use the span and I'm gonna use
20:45
some pseudo elements on the span so
20:47
that's my nav toggle label span and I'm
20:53
going to be doing it before and and
20:55
after on this label span before and my
20:59
nav toggle label span after so we're
21:04
selecting all three parts of it we're
21:06
selecting the before and after pseudo
21:07
elements as well as the span itself so
21:10
I'm going to start by giving them a
21:12
width of I don't know 2m actually before
21:14
we do that I need to make sure they show
21:18
up so let's do a display a block on all
21:20
of these a background white for now and
21:25
now we can worry about that so height of
21:28
two pixels and a width and again II
21:32
guess about two M but that might change
21:34
two M's gonna be about so yeah there we
21:37
go 32 pixels so that doesn't look too
21:40
bad and I'll do a border radius of two
21:44
pixels just around the corners on that
21:47
really subtle because it's not very big
21:49
but I think that'll look a little bit
21:51
nicer now I actually only have this one
21:54
showing up right now I don't have the
21:55
other ones and actually let's just make
21:59
this like that so we can see what we're
22:00
doing a little better I'm gonna do a
22:03
position:relative on here this is pretty
22:06
much just for my span here
22:09
the before in the after aren't showing
22:10
up yet so let's get those to appear so
22:14
the easy way to do that is to copy this
22:15
and paste it there and I need the
22:22
content property and I don't actually
22:24
want any content but if we don't have
22:26
this it defaults to none and nothing of
22:28
it shows up so I need that now you can
22:31
see that got thicker and it's because
22:32
they overlap like we have the the three
22:34
lines now do I need anything else on
22:38
here I don't think so
22:40
except I think we're gonna need a
22:42
position position:absolute I think we're
22:46
gonna need that so I'm gonna put it on
22:47
and now I can select these separately so
22:50
we'll start with my before and let's
22:56
just move it down to bottom I'm taking a
22:58
random guess seven pixels good so that
23:04
moves the bottom seven pixels and so
23:06
let's take the same thing but I want my
23:10
after and I'm gonna switch this to top
23:15
yeah I'm happy with that good good good
23:18
and when I click that it should appear
23:21
and disappear and I'm not going to do a
23:22
fancy animation on all of this if you do
23:25
want to see an animated one like this
23:27
where it turns into an X I do have
23:29
another mobile navigation that I built
23:30
out that takes a look at that but it
23:33
uses clip paths and does some other
23:34
stuff but overall I think that looks
23:39
pretty good and I'm happy with how it
23:41
works so that's cool son looks good and
23:44
it works but we want to make this look
23:46
not simply good but great we're gonna
23:49
have to use a few transitions on this
23:51
puppy to do it because we want to make
23:52
sort of little animation type of thing
23:54
so we're news transitions to make those
23:55
now the thing with transitions is to be
23:58
as high performance as possible you want
24:00
to limit your transitions to four
24:01
different properties opacity scale
24:03
translate and rotate if you'd like more
24:06
information on this I've put a link in
24:08
the description below and if not just
24:11
trust me on it it deals with repainting
24:15
and stuff like that that the browsers
24:17
have to do when you're doing transitions
24:18
and stuff
24:20
so let's go and take out our
24:21
display:none that I put in here before
24:26
not that one we want to go down onto my
24:28
navigation so we want to take that
24:30
display:none out and I want to go and
24:32
find this one and take that out too
24:35
because I want it to be here so instead
24:39
of display:none what I'm gonna do and
24:44
this is kind of weird
24:45
but I'm gonna come in here and do a
24:47
transform scale now the thing with scale
24:52
is I can put in again number so say I
24:54
did 50 or about fifty point five it will
24:58
be half the size it originally was so
25:01
0.75 would be 75% and a 1 in here would
25:05
be the actual size but you can actually
25:08
put two values in here so if I did a 1
25:10
and 0.5 it's gonna smoosh it but up and
25:14
down but this way is staying at a
25:15
hundred percent or if we switch that
25:17
around if I say 0.5 comma one it's the
25:20
opposite it's gonna smoosh it
25:22
horizontally but vertically it's staying
25:25
at a hundred percent so what I actually
25:27
want to do in this case is I want to
25:28
give it zero here which is going to
25:30
crush it all the way down but I want to
25:32
keep the width at 100% then when we get
25:38
to here I have a transform scale 1 comma
25:43
1 so now it's gonna look exactly the
25:47
same as we had before so there's
25:49
actually no difference but the advantage
25:51
with this is unlike the display:none is
25:54
I can do a transition on here so if I
25:58
come in with a transition and let's say
26:00
transform 400 milliseconds and we'll do
26:04
an ease in out and see what that looks
26:06
like so there we go so you can see it's
26:10
transitioning in and out but obviously
26:12
we have a problem it's not transitioning
26:15
from the right spot it's growing from
26:16
over here and we want it to come down
26:18
and up from the top hmm well luckily
26:22
it's not hard to fix on here my
26:25
transform I can do a transform origin
26:28
and just right in top
26:31
so the default was pretty much in the
26:32
center so now instead it's going to you
26:35
going from the top
26:37
cool so already I think that's a lot
26:40
better but it's not really what we want
26:43
the links look really funny when they
26:44
get scaled they're getting like squished
26:46
and it looks well it looks like poop to
26:48
be honest we can make the links fade in
26:52
as the scaling finishes though so
26:54
instead of squishing like this the link
26:56
sort of appear into the navigation so
27:00
remember the four properties that I can
27:02
do
27:03
there's scale translate rotate and
27:05
opacity so we're allowed to do our
27:09
opacity so let's come down onto here and
27:11
I'm going to say that my links here have
27:13
an opacity of zero so now if I do that
27:16
it just looks like my menus growing and
27:19
drinking the links are still there we
27:21
just can't see them because they have an
27:22
opacity of zero so then on here we can
27:26
add this so it's my nav toggle checked
27:33
till the nav space a get any bit more
27:37
complicated as a selector but that's
27:41
what we need we need our nav links that
27:43
are inside our nav that are next to our
27:46
sibling of my nav toggle when it's
27:49
checked and these will have an OPA
27:51
opacity of one so you can see they're
27:56
there and then they disappear and so
28:00
it's working sort of but let's go and
28:03
add in our transition on here so we can
28:07
do our transition opacity and let's do
28:12
like 250 milliseconds ease in out but
28:18
I'm also going to do a delay on this so
28:20
this is an animation delay so what that
28:23
means is take this much time before
28:26
starting my animation so now when I
28:30
click on this see how the animation when
28:33
here its own it's just finishing up and
28:36
then they come in to really illustrate
28:38
this actually it's just at a zero here
28:41
so it won't really show that way but
28:43
when I go this way and then we wait and
28:47
we wait and we wait and we wait and then
28:48
eventually they fade in so it's taking
28:50
two thousand five hundred milliseconds
28:52
two two and a half seconds then the
28:54
animation this part kicks in so by
28:57
having the delay on there just a short
29:00
delay as it comes in it goes but you'll
29:02
notice when I shrink it it's still
29:04
squishing them because the shrinking
29:06
animation happens right away there's a
29:07
delay on it so that doesn't quite work
29:10
luckily we can fix this a little bit so
29:14
if ever you've done something like
29:16
adding a transition unto something like
29:19
this with an Ave and then in a hover
29:21
whatever and you put the transition here
29:23
transitions a color you'll notice or
29:27
you'll notice that the transition only
29:30
works in one direction but not the other
29:31
one so what we can do here is this is
29:35
always on here so there's always this
29:37
delay but when I click this way I don't
29:40
want there to be a delay I only want the
29:42
delay to come when I'm opening it not
29:43
when I'm closing it so luckily what we
29:46
can actually do is add the delay here so
29:50
let's say we do transition actually I
29:53
want to copy exactly what we have here
29:56
onto this one so this means when it gets
30:01
checked and it's opening up we want it
30:03
to have that delay on it but when we
30:05
click this and it's no longer checked I
30:07
want it to be a different one so let's
30:09
just take out the delay and maybe we
30:11
could even speed this up a little bit
30:13
150 milliseconds because we need to fade
30:16
out pretty fast before it actually
30:18
starts getting smushed so now when I
30:20
click on it this way there's the delay
30:21
and then it all fades in so it's using
30:24
this one because it's using the check
30:26
state but as soon as I click this that's
30:28
no longer checked so it's no longer
30:30
checked it's not gonna use this
30:32
transition it's going to come up and
30:34
it's gonna use this transition instead
30:35
so this transition is much faster and
30:37
there's no delay on it so as soon as I
30:39
click on this you'll see it's gonna fade
30:40
out and it's gonna fade out quite fast
30:43
which is perfect because we don't see it
30:45
getting smushed and I think our timings
30:47
are actually really good on this and it
30:49
looks pretty good I'm really actually
30:50
happy with this whole thing and how it's
30:53
looking
30:53
right now so that's really cool and
30:57
really fun and there we go a nice simple
30:59
way to make a drop-down with absolutely
31:01
no JavaScript involved so it looks great
31:04
on small screens now but let's make it
31:06
look good on bigger screens because to
31:08
be honest you know that looks kind of
31:09
boring like this and you know we can we
31:13
we have room for navigation so let's
31:15
take advantage of all that room and
31:16
build one in now the width I'm gonna use
31:20
on I'm gonna make a media query I'm just
31:23
gonna do it all the way at the bottom so
31:24
I can put everything in this one media
31:25
query so the width on this is going to
31:29
be really arbitrary let's say min width
31:33
of 800 pixels I'm just using some nice
31:38
round number you choose the break point
31:40
that you're using for your design or
31:41
that works with your navigation layout
31:44
and everything so the first thing is we
31:46
don't actually need this thing anymore
31:47
right so let's turn that off so an
31:51
avatar --gel label can be a display of
31:56
none there we go and that little puppy
32:01
there is gone now the next thing we want
32:04
to do is we want to set up our header
32:06
and the header in this case I'm using
32:08
CSS grid on it so one of the nice things
32:11
about CSS grid is it has sort of done
32:14
away with the need for container divs um
32:16
so let's this up display grid and I'm
32:21
gonna make I'm gonna make three columns
32:23
on here
32:23
um so I'm gonna do grid temp late
32:27
columns um if you've never used these I
32:31
do have some videos on these as well
32:33
I've been saying that a lot I'm using a
32:34
lot of the things that I've used over
32:36
time to do this one FR so to explain
32:41
what i'm doing here is i'm setting up
32:42
four columns FR is a fraction unit so
32:44
it's pretty much left over space so I
32:47
want left over space on the left and
32:49
right Auto the logo I want it to be in
32:52
one that's automatically generated and
32:54
my navigation is gonna go in one I'll
32:57
say a minimum of 600 pixels px and a
33:02
maximum one fr I'm wondering if I need
33:05
to change that so right away you can
33:06
actually see my logo
33:07
moved over and I'm going to inspect here
33:09
I'm using so in the Firefox dev tools
33:13
there is this really nice grid inspector
33:15
so if I turn that on we can see the grid
33:18
lines that are coming up and I'm gonna
33:22
leave that on for the moment I think
33:24
just because it's gonna make
33:25
visualization of what we're doing a
33:27
little bit easier so you can see that
33:30
the those lines are right there so as I
33:34
lay things out I think it'll make a
33:35
little bit more sense and I think here
33:38
actually if I click on that I can
33:40
display my line numbers and stuff which
33:43
will help make a little bit more sense
33:46
but I'm gonna leave that off until I set
33:48
this up a bit more and I'll shrink that
33:51
down just eveness a bit more room for
33:52
the moment so I want to say where my
33:56
things are actually going on the grid so
33:57
let's just say my logo is going grid
34:01
column to spend one and now it should
34:07
move over there we go so now I can put
34:10
my grid and numbers on because my second
34:15
one here was set to auto and there was
34:17
nothing inside it it was just collapsing
34:18
there was nothing in there so it became
34:20
zero so that's what just why I'm I
34:22
didn't want to confuse too much so I
34:23
have a one two three four five
34:26
so what I'm saying is I want my logo to
34:29
start at column two so it's starting it
34:32
the the line number two and it's going
34:34
across one I could also do this as just
34:36
a two over three to make it take those
34:39
and just for example if I did this as
34:41
two over four it would take up from two
34:45
all the way to four but I don't want to
34:47
do that I want to do two over three and
34:51
what else do I need to do on my logo I
34:55
think that's it and then I can come onto
34:57
my dot my just my nav and that one would
35:02
be grid column of three over four
35:06
because I want it to start here and I
35:09
want it to go up to here now the one
35:10
problem with this is I can't actually
35:12
see it and that's just because my nav a
35:15
currently have an opacity of zero so
35:18
city of 1 so we can actually see them
35:21
well actually it's cuz there's a whole
35:23
bunch of stuff going on and so for my
35:26
nav here the other thing I'm gonna do
35:27
I'm gonna see what keeps flashing like
35:30
that is it as things go now we did a
35:33
whole bunch of styles on the nav and I
35:35
don't want to have to undo all those
35:36
styles that I already did because that's
35:38
just really annoying so there's this
35:40
really nice thing I can say all actually
35:43
I'm gonna do this above my grade columns
35:45
here I'm gonna say all and on set and
35:50
look at that I have a navigation again
35:51
so what this is doing is it's taking off
35:53
all the things that I did up before when
35:56
I did the mobile version of it it's just
35:58
take everything off of my nav so now I
36:00
can actually see it and it's going on
36:03
the grid column from 3 to 4 so that is
36:06
perfecto just as a word of caution the
36:11
all isn't a fully implemented CSS
36:13
feature yet I have the time of making
36:15
this video it won't work in IE or an
36:17
edge though it is under consideration
36:19
for edge at the moment so let's come on
36:23
my nav UL next and say a display of flex
36:27
on here so they'll go next to each other
36:28
instead of how they were so there we go
36:31
third that way I think on here I should
36:34
be able to do a flex another flex just
36:38
defy content black and there we go just
36:47
to move it all the way to the right side
36:49
um and let's put a border let's just say
36:52
border one pixel solid red I just want
36:54
to see what the height of this is right
36:55
now so on the nav itself again I'm just
37:00
gonna use this trick display flex which
37:04
will stretch that out actually that okay
37:08
we'll do on here just ePHI content flex
37:14
and and we'll do an align items Center
37:19
so that should move that over there
37:22
perfect oh good you can see that there
37:26
is an extra bit of height here right now
37:27
that's because my list items have
37:30
the margin-bottom on them so I can take
37:33
those that margin-bottom off right now
37:37
so an Ave Li margin-left let's make it a
37:43
bit bigger let's say 3 M margin-bottom
37:47
0 there we go so they're a little bit
37:51
more spread out and they're perfectly
37:53
centered in that space now and just to
37:56
look at the the one fr thing so the 1i
37:59
FAR's is taking up like available space
38:01
and shrinking and actually I realized my
38:05
min max here actually isn't gonna work
38:07
properly let's say I make that three I
38:13
think it'll work a little bit better
38:14
maybe even has to be bigger oh there we
38:17
go I think that's working out a little
38:19
bit better just saying that of the
38:22
available space so the available space
38:24
is this so this should try and be about
38:27
three times bigger than this one or that
38:29
one yeah that looks a little bit better
38:32
and then it gets to the minimum width of
38:35
600 and then right before we get too
38:38
narrow look it goes over and then we get
38:41
our drop down good good good
38:44
so that's looking pretty good the only
38:46
thing left that I want to do is add in
38:48
my little hover effect that we're gonna
38:50
put in to the navigation here so let's
38:55
scroll down and I'm only gonna do this
38:57
on my fullscreen one here so my nav a
39:04
[Music]
39:07
before right yeah I know baby four will
39:12
do it on the before and so as with all
39:14
pseudo elements we do need to give it a
39:16
content of nothing or they don't always
39:18
get nothing but most of the time when
39:20
they're design em look when they're
39:23
design elements they always get a 1 of
39:26
nothing I'll go with a height of like 5
39:28
pixels I think that's what I used last
39:29
time a background of black
39:33
so that we can see our line is already
39:36
there
39:38
let's give it a position of absolute
39:41
which will break it do to do because
39:47
let's just give them top of negative one
39:51
M let's see where that puts it left of
39:55
zero or right of zero let's see what
39:58
happens now and position relative on
40:05
here there we go okay that brought them
40:07
back good good good had me a little
40:09
worried there let's make this a bit
40:11
smaller 0.75 either bigger or smaller
40:15
but I think it worked out well where I
40:17
have it now
40:18
and I'm going to use the exact same
40:20
trick I used last time so before and
40:22
when I say last time I mean I'm gonna
40:23
use the same trick I'm gonna get rid of
40:25
these grid lines and everything this
40:28
trick here where we use the scale to
40:31
smoosh and grow things since it's a nice
40:34
little way of getting it so on here I
40:37
can bring in a transform scale the last
40:44
time we did a 1-0 because we want to do
40:46
shrink the height this time I want to
40:48
shrink only the width of it so I'm going
40:50
to do a zero comma one and we might as
40:55
well add the transition in right away
40:56
transition transform ease in out I don't
41:02
know 250 milliseconds and we'll see how
41:04
that looks
41:05
and so then my nav a:hover
41:10
before transform a scale 1 comma 1 and
41:19
let's see look at that isn't that nice
41:22
it works out perfectly so when I hover
41:24
it's growing now last time I did this I
41:28
when I was using transitions on the left
41:31
and the right and you saw if I wanted it
41:33
to grow from the center I had to do like
41:35
a 50% 50% thing and then like it was a
41:39
bit more complicated and if I wanted to
41:40
move it around so the nice thing now is
41:42
if I do want to change this I can just
41:44
do a transform
41:46
originally we did before origin left and
41:50
then my line will grow in from the left
41:52
right you put right and it will grow in
41:56
from the right and if you want it
41:59
instead of being on the top you want it
42:01
to be on the bottom that you do bottom
42:03
and now my line is coming in from the
42:06
bottom so I'm gonna put that back to the
42:09
top and I'm just going to take this off
42:11
because I sort of like this one that's
42:12
growing out from the middle like that so
42:15
we'll leave it just like that whoo that
42:19
was a long one but we made it and I
42:21
think it was worth it I'm pretty happy
42:23
with the end result but if you have any
42:24
suggestions on things I could have done
42:26
better or just questions about my
42:28
process or anything like that please
42:30
leave a comment about it in the
42:31
description below also if you have any
42:33
suggestions for other videos feel free
42:36
to leave those I love getting them I
42:38
have a really long to-do list now but
42:40
it's all from you guys suggesting stuff
42:42
that you'd like to see so if you have a
42:43
cool idea I'd gladly add it into my list
42:46
well I have to your attention and just
42:48
in case you don't know I do also have a
42:50
newsletter I started it a few maybe
42:52
about a month and a half ago it comes
42:54
out every single Sunday but instead of
42:55
big long videos like this it's little
42:57
short snippets I like to think of it as
42:59
the the things I don't have that don't
43:02
have enough substance to them to make an
43:04
actual video about so hopefully things
43:06
you can read in 3 minutes or less for
43:07
the most part mostly CSS tips and tricks
43:10
type of stuff and maybe a little bit of
43:12
design thrown in there as well
43:14
an example I haven't done one on this
43:16
but just the whole all property with the
43:18
onset there that would be the type of
43:20
thing just focused on that that I would
43:22
make a newsletter about so if that
43:23
sounds interesting to you you can go
