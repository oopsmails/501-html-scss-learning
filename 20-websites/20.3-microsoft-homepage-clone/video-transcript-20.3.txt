what's going on guys so once in a while I like to do clones html/css clones of
0:12
certain websites or web pages we did Netflix we did a CBS mobile app we've
0:17
done Pluralsight so now we're gonna do the Microsoft comm homepage which was actually requested and we're gonna do
0:24
pretty much everything except this slide show here we're just gonna have a static image but we're gonna use CSS grid for
0:30
the the cards and cards down here we're gonna use flexbox we're gonna make it responsive so this is the actual site
0:37
and then this is what we'll be building okay so this is the exact page that we'll be building and you can see it's
0:43
very very similar some of the images have changed since I actually built the project but it is fully responsive so
0:49
we'll be dealing with media queries we'll have a little bit of JavaScript because once we get down to a certain
0:55
size we're gonna make this menu go away and then we have this button here that we click to open the menu on the side
1:02
okay also down here you can see now there's only two grid columns instead of
1:08
four same thing here if I keep making it smaller it can go down to 500 pixels now
1:13
it's all stacked and nice and neat menu still works and looks good okay so it's fully responsive again we'll be dealing
1:20
with flexbox we'll be dealing with the grid so lots of modern CSS as well as html5 so let's get started all right so
1:30
the only files that we need to get started our index.html style dot CSS and
1:35
then we need all the images you can see I have an in IMG folder here with all the card images we have card one through
1:41
card eight we have the Microsoft logo social media icons the showcase image so
1:46
what I'm gonna do is put a link in the description for you to download this I guess this boilerplate with the two
1:52
files and all the images just in case you want to follow along which I would recommend okay so I'm also gonna keep
1:59
the final project open so we can reference it if we need to so let's jump into index.html and just create a
2:06
boilerplate with Emmet so exclamation Enter and just tab down to the title here and
2:12
let's say Microsoft official homepage and we want to link in our stylesheet so
2:20
we'll add a link tag to style.css and as far as the javascript there will be at
2:25
just a tiny bit just a couple lines so that we can click the menu button and have the menu slide open on on smaller
2:32
screens so we're just going to put that right in the HTML just add a script tag when the time comes all right so let's
2:40
create a container class so I'm gonna be using Emmet throughout this throughout this video so we'll say dot container
2:47
enter which will give us a class of container and inside here we want our navbar I'm just gonna put a comment here
2:53
and let's use an html5 nav tag and let's give it a class of main - nav ok and
3:01
then in here we're gonna have a few things we're gonna have the logo the main menu and then the right menu and
3:08
the right menu is this right here just these two icons which don't actually do
3:13
anything but we're gonna put them there anyway so let's start off with the logo so we have our image and I'm gonna give
3:19
it a class of logo and the source is going to be in the image folder and its logo PNG and for the alt will just say
3:28
Microsoft and then right under that let's put a ul and unloaded list with a
3:33
class of main menu and we're gonna have some list items here with a link that
3:41
isn't going to go anywhere so I'll just put a number sign and then I'm just going to copy this down let's see 1 2 3
3:47
4 5 6 so the first one is gonna be
3:54
Office second one windows
4:01
surface Xbox deals and supports all
4:13
right so that's our main menu and then right under that we're gonna have the other menu which I'm going to call right
4:20
menu now we are going to be using font awesome icons so I'm just gonna jump
4:25
back into Chrome and search for fonts let's say font awesome five CDN or you
4:32
can just go to font awesome comm but if you do that you do have to sign up and log in and create what's called a kit if
4:38
we do this we can just choose either the JavaScript or I'm just gonna grab the CSS so this right here this all dot min
4:46
I'm gonna just copy the link tag and put that right above where we brought in our
4:52
style CSS and then down in the right menu here we're gonna have a list item
4:59
and inside here we'll have an a tag and inside that we'll have an eye tag with
5:05
an icon so let's do a class of FAS font awesome and then FA - search and then
5:12
what we'll do is just copy this list item down and then this one is gonna be FA - shopping - cart so I want to check
5:22
this out so you can either open the HTML file on your file system or you can use the live server extension which is what
5:29
I'm doing so I'm gonna say open with live server and there we go so we can see the logo we have all of all of our
5:36
links and we have our two icons so before we add any more HTML let's go
5:42
ahead and start to style this well we'll add our base styles for the body and stuff like that and style the nav bar
5:49
all right so let's jump in and and I'm not going to do the responsive navigation until the end the little
5:56
hamburger menu and all that stuff so in our style CSS let's say for everything
6:02
we want to set the box sizing - border box so that the padding doesn't affect
6:09
the width or anything like that and then we want to set the margin to 0 and the in the padding to zero so we're
6:16
basically just adding a reset on every element and then for the body will set a
6:23
font family and we're gonna use this
6:28
what is it see go see goo I can't and a lot of pronounce it Segoe UI -
6:33
homogeneous verdana' sans-serif' so that's the font family I'm using and then background is going to be white and
6:41
let's set the color of the text to black so I'm using hexadecimal here and then
6:48
we'll set the font size to 15 pixels and let's set the line height to will do 1.5
6:56
for the line height alright and then we'll just do some base styles like for links let's make the color of the links
7:04
a little lighter than the black which I'm going to use two six three times
7:10
okay and then we want to take away any underlines so text decoration we'll set
7:15
that to none okay so if we look at that so far should look like this and then
7:22
for any unordered list I'm gonna take away the bullets so we'll set list the style to none okay and then we have a
7:32
container class which wraps around everything so we want that to take up almost the whole screen so we'll do with
7:39
90% but we do want to set a max width we don't want it to pass a certain width so
7:45
the max width I'm going to set to 111 hundred pixels and let's set the margin
7:52
auto which will give it even margin on all sides which we'll put it in the middle okay so if we take a look you can
7:59
see that it takes up it'll take up 90% of the screen up until you know 1,100
8:07
pixels which is the max and that's where it'll stop okay so let's jump back in
8:13
here and let's start to style the navigation so I'm going to put a comment
8:19
here just say nav so we have a class of main nav and for the navigation I usually
8:27
like to use flex for this just to line it up nicely so let's set this to
8:34
display flex and what this will do is it'll set all the inner items to flex items and align them in a horizontal row
8:41
and if we look at main nav inside we have three items the image the UL this
8:48
UL and this UL so it's just going to basically set all of those two flex items and then we can use properties
8:55
like align items and we want to Center everything okay I'm just going to see
9:02
what that does for us so if we save that now you can see everything is lined up horizontally not the list items because
9:09
remember those are in the UL those aren't directly in the main nav class
9:14
alright we'll do we'll work on those after but let's set some other things here so the main nav I'm going to set a
9:21
height of 60 pixels and let's set a
9:26
little bit of padding so we'll do 20 pixels on the top and bottom so 20 and then 0 on the left and right and then
9:33
the font size I'm gonna set a little smaller we'll do 13 pixels okay so if we
9:41
take a look at that you know what let's let's actually do this should be able to
9:49
fit both of these okay now the before we do anything else I want to handle the
9:56
the unordered list here I want this to be a flexbox as well because everything
10:01
within it should should be row should be aligned horizontal so let's take the
10:08
main nav ul and let's also display that
10:13
to flex which will set all the list items to be in a horizontal row
10:18
alright and then let's see for the main nav which is displayed flex see all the
10:26
space over here we basically want to distribute that in between the Flex items so to do that we use justify
10:33
content and we have a value called space between so if I save that it's just going to put
10:39
all in the equal number of space in between now the main menu I want to be
10:44
pushed over here next to the logo so what we can do is set the main let's say
10:52
main nav and then take the UL with the class of main menu and let's set that to
11:00
Flex one and then that will push over there but it's too close to the logo so
11:06
let's also add a margin left of 20 pixels and push that over okay and then
11:15
the logo is is too big right now if we look at the you know this page here it's
11:21
much smaller and by the way this my resolution on my machine is manin so
11:30
this might look a little smaller on my screen than it looks on yours so let's
11:36
deal with the logo I'm gonna go right here and say main nav there's a class of
11:42
logo and I'm gonna set the width of that to 110 pixels which will make it much
11:50
smaller all right and then for this for
11:55
the list items here actually I didn't put a link yeah I did put a link there's for the list items here we want to
12:02
separate those so let's go to let's go
12:08
right here and say main nav ul Li and set the padding to zero top and bottom
12:17
and then 10 pixels on the left and right which is gonna separate those out from each other okay and then when I hover
12:25
over these I want to have a little underline effect so let's say let's go
12:31
right here and take the main nav ul Li a
12:36
and let's add a hover so for the hover
12:42
state of the link I'm going to add a border border bottom and that's gonna be two
12:51
pixels solid and let's do our two six three times so now if I go and I hover
13:00
over we get this underline I do want that I do want to push the underline down a little bit so on the link let's
13:08
just grab this and say on the link we want to set padding-bottom to two pixels
13:16
so that way the line is pushed down a little more okay so I think that we
13:23
should be all set for now I mean we will be do we will make it responsive will add the hamburger menu because right now
13:29
you can see on small screens it just goes off the page which obviously we don't want but for now this is good so
13:35
let's go back to our HTML and what we want to work on next is this this part
13:41
here which is the showcase so in our HTML we'll go back we'll go down under
13:47
the nav let's put a comment here say showcase and we're gonna use a header
13:54
html5 header tag give it a class of showcase and then in here let's have an
14:01
h2 and we'll say surface deals and then
14:07
a paragraph and I'm just going to paste this text in of course you can copy it
14:13
or you can copy it from I should have the code in the description probably a code pen but we'll just put that text in
14:19
and then we want a button that says shot now or a link so let's put an a tag here
14:25
with a class of BTN so we'll style it as a button it's not actually gonna go anywhere and then we'll have some text
14:34
that'll say shot now and then I just want to have a chevron icon so we'll put an eye tag fa s fa Evren - right okay so
14:45
if we save that that's what its gonna look like which looks like crap so let's go ahead and style it so in our CSS go down let's
14:55
see let's actually let's style the button first so BTN is a class basically a utility
15:01
class that we can use anywhere so we'll style that first and for that we want to
15:07
make sure that we have a cursor that is a pointer when we hover over it and we
15:13
want to display it as an inline block
15:18
and I'm gonna set the border to zero I'm
15:24
gonna bold the font so font weight is gonna be bold and we want to add some
15:31
padding so we'll do 10 pixels top and bottom 20 pixels left and right we can
15:37
see what that looks like so far we want to add a dark background so the background we're gonna use two six three
15:45
times and then make the color of the text white and let's set the font size
15:51
to 15 pixels okay so there's our button style now when we hover over it I want
15:58
it to have some kind of effect so I'm just going to lighten the opacity a little bit so we'll say for the class
16:03
button in its hover State we're gonna set the opacity to 0.9 so just lighten
16:11
it's just slightly so we get that little effect all right so that's that now we're gonna go ahead and do the showcase
16:21
so say showcase with a class of showcase
16:28
and we want we want this showcase to have a width of a hundred percent of its container which is which is the actual
16:35
container class so it should just you know reach a hundred percent and then we're gonna set a height of 400 pixels
16:43
for this now the background is going to
16:49
be an image so we want to set that to URL and the image we want is going to be in the image folder and it's called
16:58
showcase dot JPEG now I have some props some background properties we could
17:04
either add them in separate properties or just add them here I'm gonna add them here so we'll say no-repeat okay we
17:10
don't want it to repeat a position at Center Center and we wanted to cover that area so let's save
17:16
that and now we have our background image now for the items inside let's
17:22
display them as flex items and if I do that right away it's gonna align them
17:27
into a row into a horizontal row which I don't want I want them to be in a column
17:33
which is vertical so let's set the Flex direction to column as soon as I do that
17:40
it goes back to going vertical now I want to align everything to the center
17:46
so we want to use a line items Center and let's also set actually yeah let's
17:56
save that and then I just want to make sure the text is also going to be aligned to the center so we'll add that
18:02
as well I want that I want this to be aligned not in the center because it'll
18:08
still be kind of within this image here I want it to be down here so we're gonna use justify content and we're gonna set
18:16
it to Flex end okay we have flex star which is where it is now and then flex end if I save that it pushes it down to
18:23
the very bottom however that's too low so I'm gonna also add here let's do
18:30
padding bottom for the showcase set that to 50 pixels and we also want a margin
18:38
for things under it so I'm gonna set a margin bottom to 20 pixels okay so that'll push that up a little
18:44
bit and I think that we should be all set for the showcase itself now these
18:51
are kind of squished together so let's actually take the showcase h2 and the
19:00
paragraph okay so we're styling both of these showcase paragraph and for both of
19:07
these I just want to add a margin to the bottom of 10 pixels and that'll just
19:14
kind of separate things out okay so that looks pretty good actually the button
19:21
though let's add a little more space here so I'm gonna grab the showcase and then the button inside the showcase
19:28
and let's set margin top to 20 pixels
19:34
okay so now we're going to start to work on the cards which are these right here
19:41
which by default there's going to be four okay but then we're gonna add media
19:46
queries so when we get to 700 there's 2 and 500 there's one so we're gonna actually use the grid for this here but
19:54
of course we need to do the HTML first so let's jump back into our index.html
19:59
whoops and then we'll go under our showcase which is the header right here
20:05
and I'm just gonna make this a little bigger
20:11
alright so we're actually gonna have two cards sections so put a comment here and
20:17
say home cards just one and let's use a section html5 section tag here and give
20:25
it a class of home cards and inside here we're going to have a div which is gonna
20:32
be each group this is gonna be set to grid display grid and then each div will
20:37
be a great item and in each grid item we'll have an image which is gonna be
20:43
let's say image slash card one JPEG
20:50
I'll just leave the alt blank and then let's do an h3 we're gonna say new
20:56
surface pro 7 and then a paragraph so
21:02
I'm just gonna grab the text again I should I'll have the code in the description so if you want to just copy the text you can do that and then under
21:10
the paragraph the last thing we want inside each grid item in each div is a link so let's put a link here that just
21:17
goes nowhere and say learn more and then we'll have a chevron write icon so FA s
21:25
fa dash Chevron - right all right so if I save
21:32
that this is what it's going to look like now we have what three more cards
21:39
because there's going to be four in a row so I'm actually going to paste these in because it's the same thing it's just different content so let me just grab
21:46
these three divs and again if you want to grab it from the code you can so we
21:52
have card one that we just did and then we have another div with card - okay so
21:58
we have different text as well just to make it look real and then another div
22:03
here card three and then we have our last one so if I save this we just have three element three divs on top of each
22:11
other so let's jump into our CSS and we want to use the grid here to style this
22:16
okay so let's see let's put a comment
22:22
we'll say home cards and I can make this
22:27
smaller
22:33
okay so home cards let's give a class of home - cards and to use the grid we want
22:42
to set this to display grid not grudge grid if I do that nothing happens
22:49
because we have to let it know what columns or rows or whatever we're doing so we're gonna use grid template columns
22:56
and with this we could set each one to like like we could do you know 50 pixels
23:05
50 pixels if I did that it'll give us two two columns that are 50 pixels wide
23:11
which is obviously not what we want if we wanted four we would just do 50 pixels 50 pixels that'll give us four
23:19
that are 50 pixels wide now I'm going to use something called a fractional or a fraction an F our unit which are
23:28
basically just slices of of the grid container so for instance if I do one fr
23:35
if I save that that's going to put each one in one column if we do two of
23:41
these f1 FRS then we get two columns if we do three then we get three if we do
23:49
one in five four we get four which is what we want now instead of doing it
23:56
like this we have a function called repeat we can use and we can say repeat four times one of our and we get the
24:04
same result now the reason that it's kind of going off the page here is because of the images images are always
24:11
going to go out of their container unless we set the width to be restricted
24:17
to be a hundred percent of the container so let's say home cards image and we
24:23
want to make sure that we set the width of these images to a hundred percent of the container that way they don't go
24:28
outside of that column that grid column now I don't want these to be right
24:33
squished up against each other so we're gonna use a property called grid gap so
24:41
with the grid system we don't even have to use margin to separate out the the actual items we can use grid gap and
24:47
we're gonna set that to 20 pixels and save and now you can see we have some space in there so the grid gap is 20
24:53
pixels and we also have 20 pixels margin bottom on the showcase so these are even
24:59
the spacing here and then the images I also want some space underneath so let's also add a margin bottom there of 20
25:09
pixels push that text down a little bit and then the h3 also wants with spacing
25:15
so we'll say home cards h3 and let's just do 5 pixels for the margin bottom
25:23
there and then these here these links we
25:29
want to handle those so let's say home cards a and I want to display these as
25:37
an inline block because they're displayed inline by default and we want
25:44
to be able to add padding top ten pixels and let's set the color to
25:53
hexadecimal value of zero zero six seven b8 which is a bluish color and then
26:03
we're gonna set I want them to be uppercase so we'll set text transform to
26:08
uppercase and let's see the last thing
26:14
we're gonna do here is just set them to be bold so we'll set the font weight to
26:20
bold like that okay and it's kind of squishy it looks better if you stretch
26:26
it out like that once we hit like seven hundred pixels we're gonna change this switch some things up so that for
26:33
instance these are and there's only two columns and so on but we'll do that after we'll do the media queries after
26:39
so let's see the when I can I hover over
26:46
one of these links here I want the chevron to kind of push out a little bit
26:51
so what we'll do is take the home cards and say when we hover over the link when
26:57
the link is in the hover state then we want to take the icon and we want to just add a margin left to it of 10
27:04
pixels okay so that way when I hover over you can see it just kind of pushes
27:10
out a little bit so that takes care of the first set of home cards now we want
27:15
the Xbox area which is this so let's add that HTML just going to make this a
27:22
little bigger for now so we'll go let's see we have our section so we want to go
27:30
under this section and then we'll have our Xbox section we'll give this a class
27:37
of Xbox so in here we're going to have a div at the class of content it's
27:44
basically we're gonna have a background image and then we have this element with the content inside of it
27:49
which is going to have an H to say xbox
27:55
game pass Ultimates and a paragraph which I'm going to just grab real quick
28:04
and then under that will have an a tag and this is going to be our button so we
28:10
want our BTN class here okay and then inside here we'll say join now and again
28:19
I want to have a chevron icon so FA s fa - Chevron right okay so if I save that
28:29
you can see this is what it looks like here now I do want to add some margin to the home cards I forgot to do that so in
28:37
our CSS right here home cards let's say margin bottom and let's do I think 40
28:46
pixels is what we want yeah okay and then that should be it for the Xbox HTML
28:53
so we can actually go back to the CSS and then let's start on that so I'll make this smaller just so we can see
28:59
what we're doing here and let's put a comment here this is the Xbox styling so
29:10
the first thing we want to do is the Xbox class itself so I'm going to give
29:17
this a height of 350 pixels and we want
29:22
to width of a hundred percent okay and
29:27
then just set a background image so we'll say background:url and the image
29:33
is going to be image oops we need quotes here image / Xbox PNG and we're gonna
29:44
set some properties here so no-repeat Center center slash cover
29:52
and save okay so now we have our background image now we have to style the content that is within it so
30:00
remember we have a class of content so Xbox and then we want the content class inside of that and I'm just gonna set a
30:07
width of 40% because I don't want to spread all the way across so that kind of contains it to the left here and then
30:15
for the padding let's do 50 on the top zero zero and then 30 pixels on the left
30:23
just to push it down and out okay and then the paragraph let's see let's say
30:29
Xbox paragraph and I'm gonna set a margin of 10 let's do 10 0 20 just to
30:41
kind of break this up a little bit and then that should be it yeah so the next
30:48
thing let's see what's after that so we have another set of cards after that and what's nice is we can use the same
30:55
classes and same styling so I'm gonna go back into our HTML and basically we're
31:05
gonna have this the same thing we have here with with our home cards we're gonna do four home cards too except
31:12
they're gonna be just it's just going to be different content so I'm gonna just copy this and paste it in so we're gonna
31:20
go under Xbox under the section here and paste it in and notice that it's the
31:25
same exact thing the class is home cards the only difference within the divs is the content so different image different
31:33
text okay so I'm gonna save this and if we take a look it's pretty much already
31:38
styled we just we just need to separate this here so let's go back into our CSS
31:44
and for the Xbox class let's add a
31:50
margin bottom of 40 pixels
31:56
actually let's do 20 pixels there so
32:04
that's all styled after that we have this area which I'm just calling carbon
32:10
because it's committing to carbon negative so that's going to have a class of carbon so we'll go under the home
32:17
cards too and it's put a comment here say carbon did I add a comment for ya I
32:25
didn't okay so for this here let's say
32:30
section give it a class of carbon and then we'll have a class of content so
32:38
it's kind of like what we did with the Xbox and we'll have an h2 will say committing committing to carbon negative
32:49
and then a paragraph which I'm going to grab the text for and then under that
32:58
we'll have an eight it's actually we'll just copy we'll copy this right here
33:04
this join now and put that here except
33:10
it's gonna say learn more and I don't know why this is going to an a tag that
33:15
should be a number sign alright so if I
33:21
save that let's take a look okay so what it looks like now let's style it so
33:27
we'll jump into our style sheet here and it'll just make this smaller say this is
33:38
the carbon section
33:43
okay so for this four-carbon we're going to set the height to 350 so it's
33:54
basically just like the xbox one height and width of 100 yeah 100%
33:59
and then a background image so this is
34:09
image / carbon jpg no-repeat Center
34:18
Center and cover okay and by the way
34:24
this is the background repeat' property this is the background position this is the background size now as far as the
34:32
the content inside let's style that so let's say carbon and we have our content
34:42
which wraps around the h2 the paragraph and link and I'm going to set the width
34:48
of this to 55% okay and then to position
34:54
it let's do padding 100 pixels from the top okay so we'll do 100 pixels top and
35:02
then 30 on the left and that will position it now as far as the colors
35:08
here I want to change the color of the text in the button so I think what I'm gonna do is put a class a utility class
35:16
on the carbon section right here called dark meaning that it's it's a dark
35:21
background so we need light text and a light button so back in our style sheet
35:26
I'm gonna put this up at the top because it's basically like a utility kind of like the button class so we'll say dot
35:33
dark so if it has a class of dark then we want the color to be light because it
35:38
means it has a dark background so the color is going to be white and then
35:43
let's see in addition to that we want to
35:48
set the button so we'll say if it's dark and then there's a button inside of it
35:57
then that button background we want to be light so I'm gonna use F for three
36:03
times which is light gray and then the color of the textile set to a dark color so triple three now if I save that and
36:11
this is this is light here we want to separate this stuff out a bit just like
36:18
we did with Xbox so I think what we can do is go to where we have our Xbox
36:25
paragraph and let's just also add in here our carbon paragraph and save and
36:33
now that will add this margin here to this as well and then I'm pretty sure
36:38
that's all we need to do as far as the carbon area goes so next we have this
36:45
which is this follow or social area so let's go back to our HTML and let's go
36:53
under the section here and this is going to be the what are we gonna call this
36:59
let's call this follow so put a comment here we'll put a section with a class of
37:07
follow and we'll have a paragraph that says follow Microsoft and then we're
37:16
gonna have some links and then these links are just gonna have them go to
37:22
like social media sites so HTTPS
37:28
facebook.com and then inside the link here we're gonna have the Facebook icon
37:34
well not icon it's actually an image you could use font awesome icons but I'm
37:39
just using images so let's put an image tag and let's have this go to IMG / and
37:47
this is going to be social FB okay and then for the alts we'll just
37:54
say Facebook and then we're gonna do the same for Twitter and LinkedIn so I'll
37:59
just copy this a tag down twice so this one will be Twitter and then let's do
38:07
social - Twitter for the image change
38:14
that to Twitter and then this will be LinkedIn and it's a social - LinkedIn
38:25
and this will be LinkedIn okay so we'll save that and you can see
38:33
the image here and the follow Microsoft so we want to style this a little bit we want this we want the follow Microsoft
38:39
to be in line with the rest of these so let's use flex for that so in our CSS
38:45
under carbon let's do our follow styles so we'll take follow and let's display
38:55
flex and as soon as I save that it's going to turn it into a flex row which
39:01
is what we want but we want to align the items to the center so if I do that you
39:07
can see now the paragraph is in the middle here let's also do a justify
39:17
content flex start which will make sure it's aligned at the beginning and then
39:22
for the margin for the margin we're gonna do 30 pixels top let's do 0 30
39:30
pixels and save and now yeah that looks
39:36
good we do need to push we need some spacing in between all this so what I'm gonna do
39:42
is take the follow class and say everything within it so we'll use an asterisk asterisk care and just give it
39:48
a margin right of let's do 10 pixels save and now it's going to space this
39:55
stuff out for us okay so that's good next we have these two areas now this is
40:03
basically a one big footer however I'm calling this right here with the you ELLs four links so this will have a class of
40:11
links this whole thing and then this will have this will be the footer this part here so let's go to our HTML and
40:18
let's add will just add both of those at once alright so under this section here let's
40:24
say links and this is going to be a section and give it a class of links and
40:33
then we want to have a links in ER and the reason I'm doing this is because there is going to be basically a
40:40
container that stops the content here and here however I want the background
40:46
color to extend all the way out so we don't want to actually actually know
40:51
what one thing I did wrong is I have I still have it in the container you can see this this is the ending of the container and I don't want that because
40:58
then the color the background color would end here and I wanted to extend all the way out so for that then I
41:06
wanted I want this div the container div to end here after follow I don't want it
41:14
to I don't want it to go around the links here so we're gonna have a class in here called links - inner and then
41:24
we'll have all of our you ELLs so I'm going to just paste these in so each unordered list is just gonna be you know
41:32
have allies this first one is going to be the title so it's gonna be an h3 and then the rest will just be links so we
41:39
have that one and then I'll just grab the rest here again you can copy this
41:45
from the code if you don't want to type all this crap out okay so I paste in all the you ELLs and like I said we're just
41:53
gonna do the foot or two so underneath this section say footer and we're gonna
42:00
use the html5 footer tag for this and we'll give it a class of let's go I guess let's do mein - footer
42:11
and in here is gonna be this part so
42:16
we're gonna have again it's gonna extend all the way out so we don't want it to be in the container and we do want to
42:24
put a limit on how far it goes out like this content we don't want to keep going out here so we're gonna set an inner
42:30
class here as well so let's say footer - inner actually we'll just call this
42:36
class footer so we have footer and footer inner and we'll have a div so
42:44
this div is gonna be this right here this little icon the globe icon with the
42:49
English so let's put an eye tag with FAS
42:56
and let's do FA - globe and then with
43:01
font awesome you can make icons bigger with FA - 2 X 3 X 4 X so we're gonna do
43:07
2 X so that'll give us the globe icon and then next to it we're gonna say English English and then in parenthesis
43:17
the United States okay and then under that div will be a UL and this is going
43:25
to have all the the other links which I'm just gonna grab real quick oops
43:30
those in here okay so we have just a bunch of links and then at the bottom we
43:36
just have this HTML entity for the copyright symbol excuse me and then
43:41
Microsoft 2020 so that should do it for the HTML so if we take a look at it it
43:48
doesn't look very good so we have quite a bit of styling to do here so let's jump into style.css and go underneath
43:57
our follow and let's start with links okay so first thing we're gonna do here
44:04
for links is set the background and we want the background to be a grey
44:10
which we're gonna do f2 three times and then the color of the text is going to be a little lighter than black it's
44:16
gonna be six one three times guys if I
44:22
save that you can see now we have the gray background the lighter text we're gonna set the font size to be smaller as
44:29
well let's do 12 pixels and then overall
44:34
padding for the links section is gonna be 35 on the top and bottom okay so I
44:41
save that that's what it's gonna look like now for the links inner I want that
44:48
to be a grid okay so if we look at this links inner if we set this to display
44:54
grid every direct child will be a grid item and every direct child is a ul
45:00
right because we want the you ELLs to be aligned in grid columns so let's set
45:07
links inner actually before we even do
45:12
the grid stuff let's set a max width because again we don't want the content to go all the way out we wanted to have
45:20
a max width of the the same number as the container above which is 1100 pixels
45:25
and we want it to be aligned in the middle so let's do margin 0 on the top
45:31
and bottom auto on the left and right to make sure it's in the middle and just add a padding of 20 pixels on the left
45:39
and right okay so now we'll go ahead and display grid and we could probably you
45:46
know let's make this smaller all right
45:52
so if I display grid I'm gonna save this and it's not going to do anything because again we need to set our grid
45:58
template columns and we want to have 6 there's 6 you ELLs so we want to do
46:05
repeat 6 times 1 fraction or 1fr make
46:12
this a little bigger
46:19
okay so once I save this now they're gonna align in a grid which is what we
46:24
want and then for the grid gap which is the space in between we'll do ten pixels like that let's go ahead and align the
46:34
items to flex start and then let's set the justify content to Center all right
46:44
so you can see that it kinda they kind of just extend in and out when we hit a certain point like 700 we're gonna
46:51
change the grid template columns but on large screens that looks fine like I
46:57
said we'll do the media queries after so let's see these are too close together
47:04
these list items so let's take links Li
47:10
and let's really spread out the line height to say 2.8 like that and then
47:19
let's set the color of the actually that should be fine right you know yeah we'll
47:27
keep that as is alright so I think that that's that's good for now until we get to the media queries now let's do this
47:33
footer part down here so we have a class
47:40
of footer and I want the background
47:47
background is going to be the same gray which is f2 and color same color as the
47:57
links okay good font size
48:04
12 pixels and padding 20 on the top and
48:10
bottom good and then we also have a
48:15
footer inner so it's a footer - inner and we're gonna set just like the links
48:24
we're gonna set the max width to 1100
48:31
and the margin to 0 auto which will put
48:36
it in the middle padding let's do 20 0
48:42
20 and I'm gonna display as flex now the
48:49
this footer enter only has two inner elements which is the div and the UL so the UL we're also going to want us
48:57
display this as flex so that these list items will will show in a row let's see
49:04
so we want to align items Center and let's justify the content to the space
49:11
between so any remaining space will go in between the two elements here and
49:16
they're also aligned Center now let's do
49:24
let's do the UL so we have our links say
49:31
links ul not links footer P well and we
49:37
want to display as flex okay so they'll put them all in a row now when this gets
49:48
smaller I actually want it to wrap I want these to go on top of each other so
49:54
we can use a property called flex wrap and set that to wrap and save and now
50:01
they'll just kind of go on top of each other and they don't go out of the screen it doesn't look great but I mean
50:08
it's it's you can see see all the links and it doesn't go off the screen and
50:13
it's it's workable and it's what the the actual Microsoft site does so let's see
50:20
this looks horrible so let's do the list items for our list item let's set margin right to 30 pixels
50:33
and we'll do a margin I'm gonna set margin bottom 20 on both the Allies and
50:41
on the div which I haven't added yet so let's say footer div so the footer div
50:51
is this right here and notice actually let me just do this first so I'll save
50:58
now I'm just gonna stretch this out just
51:03
show you something so it's notice that this is not aligns with this it's pushed
51:08
down more to fix that I'm gonna set that div right here the footer div to display
51:15
flex and then also just set a line items Center which will put it right in the
51:22
center along with the rest of these all right let's just leave this like that
51:28
for now all right so let's see what else do we have to do here I think that's
51:36
really it well let's push this out see how this icon is like right on top of
51:41
the word English so we'll take let's see
51:47
here we'll say footer div icon and just add a margin right of
51:57
let's do 10 pixels okay so I think that
52:03
looks pretty good I mean this is yeah this looks decent on full screen now if
52:08
we go down to you know 700 500 pixels 600 pixels it doesn't look very good so
52:15
we do have some stuff to do here we have some media queries too right so the last thing I'm gonna do is the
52:21
menu the little hamburger and stuff like that so I want to put it to like between
52:28
six and seven hundred pixels we'll try it right there and then we'll go ahead and add our media queries so let's go
52:36
down to the very bottom and we're gonna have two media queries one is going to be four screens that are 700 pixels and
52:43
below and one will be four screens that are 500 pixels in below so let's say at
52:48
media and set a max width of 700 pixels
52:54
so any styles we put in here will only be in effect if the screen is 700 pixels
53:00
are smaller so let's start off let's start off with the cards the home cards
53:07
which is going to be pretty easy because right now we have if we go back up here
53:13
to where we have the home cards we have display grid and then our grid template
53:19
columns we have four columns right you can see right here four columns I want
53:24
to change it to two on 700 pixels and below so I'm gonna just take this grid
53:30
template columns and put that right in here and just change this to two 1fr so
53:39
if I save that now anything below 700 pixels we're gonna get two columns for
53:45
home cards and that's gonna that's going to do the same thing down here alright so home cards is pretty much taken care
53:52
of I I do want just one when it's on 500
53:57
pixels or less but we'll do that in a minute let's just get this set up first this is basically like a tablet view
54:03
so the Xbox this doesn't look too good I think the only thing I want to change here is make it so that there's no
54:12
paragraph so it's just Xbox game ultimate and then the button so that's
54:17
really easy we can just set the Xbox say Xbox content paragraph and set that to
54:29
display:none okay now that still doesn't look too good just because the button is
54:36
so close to the text so let's also take the Xbox content h2 and let's add a
54:47
margin bottom of 20 pixels all right I think that looks pretty good now let's
54:55
see down here we have kind of the same issue going on with with this carbon
55:01
instead of taking away the paragraph though I'm just gonna make this this
55:07
content stretch out further okay I didn't want to do that here because we won't be able to read the text just away
55:14
the way this background image is and you could handle this many different ways you could switch out the image you can
55:19
change images based on screen size if you want but I'm gonna go ahead and set the carbon content which I believe is
55:29
55% with I'm going to set it to 85 on smaller screens so it looks like that
55:37
okay and then let's go down here the links I'm gonna change the the
55:42
arrangement of columns here as well so let's say links and then we have links
55:48
inner which is where the grid is that's where we did display grid and again we'll just take the grid template
55:56
columns and let's repeat instead of having six let's do two one fr-s
56:02
like that okay and then for the actually
56:08
I think that's it because this I'm just going to leave that footer because it wraps
56:14
but yeah that should be good for 700 now if we go smaller I want things to change
56:22
up a little bit more for instance the home cards I then want to only have one column so let's add another media query
56:31
below this one so we'll go right here and say that media max with 500 pixels
56:42
okay and then let's just take this put
56:50
that in here and all we need now we don't need any repeats because we're just using one fractional unit and there
56:55
we go so now all the cards are just one column as far as the links go I think I
57:04
only want to have these in one column that's what the actual Microsoft site does as well so let's take this that
57:13
here and same thing change this to one fr and if we take a look now good I do
57:23
want to add a little bit of space between all the you ELLs so let's take links links in our ul and just set a
57:35
margin bottom to 20 pixels yeah so I
57:41
think that looks pretty good looks decent now we can start to work on the menu so to work on the menu I'm
57:49
gonna make this a little bigger like that now for the menu button we need to
57:55
create that because if we if we go to this to the finished product you can see we have this little button here and we
58:00
click that in the menu opens so first thing we'll do is create that button because we don't even have that in our
58:06
HTML right now so I'm gonna go up to the top here and the button is going to be
58:14
positioned absolute so I'm gonna put it at the very top in the body hope even
58:19
above the container and it's just going to be a div with the class of menu - BTN
58:25
and inside here we'll have an icon with a class of FA s and then FA - bars and
58:33
we want to make it a little bigger so FA - 2 X like that so if I save that it's
58:42
just going to be put into the regular flow of the page which we don't want we want to take it out by positioning and
58:48
absolute so let's go to our style.css and let's set we'll put this at the top
58:58
here we'll just go go right above button
59:04
and say menu - BTN and let's set
59:10
first of all cursor - pointer so when we hover over it we get a pointer and then we want to position this absolute so if
59:23
I do that you can see now it's taken out of the flow of everything else and it's just positioned absolute in the top
59:29
corner here now as far as the positioning I'll say from the top let's
59:34
move it down a little so we'll say from the top we want to do 20 pixels and then from the right because we actually want
59:40
it on the right side we'll set it 30 pixels from the right like that and then
59:47
I'm just going to set a z-index so that it's always on top we'll set that to 2
59:53
now we obviously don't want this displayed on you know when it's when
59:59
it's a large screen and we can actually see the menu items so we're gonna set the display on this to none and then we
1:00:08
want it to show when we hit a certain point when we hit the 700 so let's go
1:00:13
down to our media query just right here
1:00:19
and we'll just put all this stuff at the top here so now our menu button
1:00:26
we want to set from display:none - let's say display:block and now it shows
1:00:34
because we're at 700 or lower if I go up more you can see it it appears and
1:00:39
reappears depending on the screen size so when we're at this size 700 or less
1:00:46
we don't want the the main menu to show like at least like this we want it to
1:00:52
show like this if this is clicked basically if we put a class of show on
1:00:58
it so let's start to style this which is the main menu so we're going to go out
1:01:05
here and say actually one thing I want to do is when I hover over the this
1:01:10
button here I just want it to fade a little bit so let's just quickly just add menu button hover and just set
1:01:17
opacity to 0.5 so that way we just get a little hover effect now for the main
1:01:25
menu let's say dot what does it mean nav
1:01:31
and then we have a ul with the class of main menu so we have quite a few styles
1:01:39
to do here we basically need to turn it from this into this ok so first thing
1:01:46
I'm going to do is set the display to
1:01:51
block because I believe it's yeah it's flex by default okay and then we're
1:01:57
going to position this absolute so basically take it out of the the relative flow position in absolute which
1:02:05
is going to put it over there and then set it to top:0 left:0 and and
1:02:18
remember it's it's still within the container that's why it's not all the way over to the left but we're going to
1:02:24
fix that with the translate X property so let's set the width well actually
1:02:32
let's do the background first just so we can kind of see where it begins and ends so background is going to be gray so
1:02:38
it's F three times and let's set the width of
1:02:45
this to 50% if I save that it's gonna be 50% width and the height I want to be
1:02:52
the entire thing so 100% alright so so far so good let's see we want try to
1:03:04
think here we don't want this little space right here so we can fix that with
1:03:09
transform and then set the translate X so the X access which is horizontal
1:03:18
access we want to push it bring it over to the left so we have to do a negative value and we're going to do negative 20
1:03:25
pixels so that will clear that little space there now the next thing I want to
1:03:32
do is add a border so I'm going to have let's say border on the right of CCC one
1:03:45
pixel solid okay just give it a little border I want it to be a little bit
1:03:50
see-through so I'm going to set the opacity from 1 to 0.9 which will give it
1:03:56
that see-through look let's see and then padding so all around padding of 30
1:04:04
pixels which pushes everything in I
1:04:09
think that's all I want to do for now now initially this is going to be off
1:04:15
screen and I'm not going to set like display:none or anything I'm gonna
1:04:21
basically push it over here off the screen and we can do that with the
1:04:27
translate X so I wanted to just do this
1:04:33
to show you guys so I could actually style it and you could see it but initially this is going to be set to fun
1:04:39
negative 500 where it's off the screen and then what's going to happen is if we have a class of show so I'm just going
1:04:47
to go down here and set this main nav ul dot
1:04:52
main menu and if it has a class of show then we're gonna have a display like we
1:04:59
just had it so I'm just gonna paste that and and put this to negative-20 and what's going to happen when we click
1:05:06
this button here it's going to toggle that class of show which will bring it from translate X 5 negative 500 which is
1:05:13
over here to negative 20 which will bring it to where it just was so what
1:05:18
I'm going to do is just physically are high just hard code that show class on
1:05:24
to it in the HTML for now so we can see it like that but I'll remove that after
1:05:30
and then we'll just add the functionality to click the button but we'll do that just so we can see it so
1:05:35
we can finish styling it because these links don't look too good so we're gonna grab let's take this and let's do the LI
1:05:46
our allies and just add a padding of 10
1:05:51
pixels and then let's do a border bottom of ccc solid one pixel and let's make
1:06:02
the font size a little bigger too I'll do let's try 14 yeah now if we if
1:06:10
you don't want this bottom border because it doesn't really make sense to have that we can just take this here and
1:06:17
we can use a pseudo selector of last child which is just going to take the
1:06:26
last list item and set the border bottom to zero save that now we don't have that
1:06:35
bottom border anymore now the last thing we want to do in our CSS is see these little icons here the the button is
1:06:41
covering it so I want to push those over a little which is very simple so we'll just go up here and that has I believe
1:06:50
it has a class of right menu so we'll say main nav ul dot right menu
1:06:59
and set a margin right of 50 pixels and
1:07:04
save and now it just pushes that over okay and if I make this bigger you can see everything it just goes back to
1:07:10
normal so now we need to remove this show class from the HTML because we want
1:07:16
to add that dynamically with JavaScript so we'll go down to the bottom all the
1:07:23
way down and from here go right above the body tag and just add in a script
1:07:30
tag here so we want to select this button here which has a class of menu
1:07:36
BTN so let's say document we can use a document object and then use query
1:07:41
selector okay so this will select anything in the DOM and we're going to take the element with the class of menu
1:07:48
- BTN and then we want to add an event listener so we'll call dot add event
1:07:55
listener and this will take in the event we want to listen for which is a click and it also takes in a function I'm just
1:08:02
going to use an arrow function here and all we want to happen now is to add that
1:08:07
show class to the main menu so we'll select the main menu document dot we'll
1:08:13
use query selector here again and we'll take the class of main menu and we're
1:08:24
gonna say dot class list I know this is scrunched up but we're gonna take class
1:08:30
list which is the property which has all of its classes and then there's a there's methods we can use like add
1:08:36
remove and toggle we want to toggle the class of show okay so hopefully that
1:08:43
makes sense when we hit the menu button which is this we want to listen for a click OK so as soon as we click it it'll
1:08:50
run this function it'll select the main menu which is that whole menu that we just styled that's not showing right now
1:08:58
because it's off the screen and it'll add the class of show and as soon as that happens when that show class is
1:09:05
added it goes from translate X negative 500 which pushes it off the screen to
1:09:11
negative 20 pixels which puts it in that position where it shows so I'm gonna just go
1:09:17
ahead and reload and I'm gonna hit that and now it shows so one thing that I
1:09:22
actually forgot to do when the CSS was at a transition because I don't want it to just pop up like that I wanted to
1:09:28
transition into it slowly so it gives it that slide effect so in our CSS we just
1:09:35
need to add one line to this this main menu right here so right under the transform let's add a transition and it
1:09:44
needs to know what property do we want to add the transition on and that's going to be the transform okay because
1:09:50
the transform is what changes this translate X value and then the time it
1:09:55
takes let's say 0.5 seconds and then the effect which we'll use ease in out so
1:10:02
now if I go ahead and I click this now it slides in it has a transition okay so
1:10:08
it has kind of this animation instead of just popping in which makes it look much nicer alright so that's it so this is
1:10:15
what it looks like fullscreen which looks pretty good and
1:10:20
then we get down to 700 pixels and the menu goes away up here this gets pushed
1:10:27
over this gets disappears and then we can go ahead and open the menu and then
1:10:33
if it's even smaller you know these all stack up so these are all one column and the menu still works so it comes out to
1:10:40
50% regardless of the size of the screen so that's it guys hopefully you enjoyed
1:10:46
this little project here and you learned a little bit more about CSS or even HTML
1:10:52
but that's it thanks for watching I really appreciate it and I'll see you in the next video
